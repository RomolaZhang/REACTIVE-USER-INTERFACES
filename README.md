# REACTIVE-USER-INTERFACES

This is an IMA elective course of the computation & data categoty. It focuses on basic knowledge of React.js and how it can benefit interactive web development. We looked at the React component hierarchy, the JSX templating system, how to load and display dynamic data from APIâ€™s, etc. We learned to design and build beautiful and functional UIs through the process.
