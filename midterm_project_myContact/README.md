# myContact

This is designed to be a simple mobile contact app that offers various options to change the preview, sorting method and color style. One main thing I want to elaborate here is the userâ€™s control over this app about what content style they would like to see. In the meantime, it is equally important not to give users too much work so that they get confused. Therefore, I chose a clean and clear layout to enhance affordance and accessibility of the functionalities.
